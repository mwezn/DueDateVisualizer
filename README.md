# DueDateVisualizer
This was my first project for a client on Upwork.com.
Its some basic data science/ data visualisation based on an outdated survey of pregnant women at several hospitals worldwide.
Its purpose is to calculate the probability of women given birth naturally on their expected due date
based only on the CSV file thats included. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: its not accurate
More accuracy requires more Data!
