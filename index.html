<div id="exp">This was my first project for a client on Upwork.com. It uses the data visualisation library D3.js & uses a CSV file based on an outdated survey of 100s of pregnant women at several hospitals. 
 Its purpose is to calculate the probability of women given birth naturally on their expected due date based only on the CSV file thats included.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Its NOT designed for accurate medical advice. More accuracy requires more data! The purpose of this was simply to demonstrate data science techniques such as tidying & visualising data
  Here the continous lognormal distribution function was computed to generalise the discrete data taken
from a survey of women on <a href="https://spacefem.com/pregnant/charts/duedate0.php">spacefem.com</a>. <br>
Click <a href="https://spacefem.com/pregnant/charts/sf_gestationdata.csv">here</a> to download the CSV file. <br>
Or click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution">here</a> to read more about the Log-Normal distribution
